  [[file:data/qr.png]]

  Crier is a utility for Android\trade-based phones to announce events with a
  Text-to-Speech(TTS) engine. Currently crier will announce incoming
  calls and text messages as well as the top and bottom of the
  hour. Crier will try to identify callers from your contacts and by
  looking up the region from the area code.

  Text-to-Speech functionality is provided by the [[http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/][eyes-free]] project.

  Crier is available for purchase in the [[market:crier][Android Market]] at a price of
  $0.99 USD.  The source code to Crier is freely available under the
